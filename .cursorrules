# ProvenanceCode Rules for Cursor IDE

**MANDATORY**: This project uses ProvenanceCode for architectural decision tracking. All AI assistance MUST follow these rules and enforce the ProvenanceCode structure.

## Core Principles (ENFORCED)

1. **Read decisions first**: Before suggesting architectural changes, check `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/` for existing decisions
2. **Follow established patterns**: All code suggestions MUST align with accepted decisions
3. **Reference decisions**: Include decision IDs in code comments for significant implementations
4. **Flag violations**: Alert when suggestions might contradict existing decisions
5. **Suggest decisions**: Recommend creating new decision records for architectural changes

## Decision Record Locations (REQUIRED)

- **All decisions**: `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/`
- **Decision template**: `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/TEMPLATE/`
- **Decision schema**: `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/schemas/decision.schema.json`
- **Policies**: `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/policies/`
- **Tools**: `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/tools/`

## Before Suggesting Code (MANDATORY CHECKS)

### 1. Check for Relevant Decisions

ALWAYS search for decisions related to:
- The technology or framework being used
- The architectural pattern being implemented
- The area of the codebase being modified
- Security, authentication, or data handling approaches

### 2. Verify Decision Status

Only follow decisions with status:
- `accepted` - Approved and ready for implementation
- `implemented` - Already in production

Ignore decisions with status:
- `deprecated` - No longer valid
- `rejected` - Not approved
- `superseded` - Replaced by another decision

### 3. Apply Decision Constraints

If a decision exists:
- Follow its specified approach exactly
- Use the technologies/patterns it mandates
- Reference the decision ID in your suggestion
- Don't suggest alternatives unless specifically asked

## Code Suggestion Guidelines (ENFORCED)

### Include Decision References (REQUIRED)

For significant code, include comments referencing decisions:

```javascript
/**
 * User authentication service
 * Implements JWT-based authentication per decision #004
 * @see provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/004-jwt-authentication/decision.md
 */
class AuthenticationService {
  // implementation
}
```

```python
# Database connection pool
# Uses PostgreSQL per decision #001
# See: provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/001-use-postgresql/decision.md
def get_db_connection():
    # implementation
```

### Follow Established Patterns

If a decision establishes a pattern, follow it consistently:

```typescript
// Decision #003 establishes REST API conventions
// ✅ CORRECT: Follow the pattern
router.get('/api/v1/users/:id', authenticateJWT, getUser);

// ❌ WRONG: Don't deviate from the pattern
router.post('/api/getUser', { id: 123 });
```

### Flag Potential Violations (MANDATORY)

When a suggestion might violate a decision, STOP and alert:

```
⚠️ VIOLATION ALERT: This suggestion uses MongoDB, but decision #001 specifies PostgreSQL 
as the primary database. 

Current decision (#001): All persistent data uses PostgreSQL

Options:
1. Revise to use PostgreSQL (recommended)
2. Create a new decision if MongoDB is needed for a specific use case
3. Update decision #001 if requirements have changed

Would you like me to revise the suggestion to use PostgreSQL?
```

## Decision-Specific Rules

<!-- 
Update this section with your project-specific decisions.
Add key decisions that affect code suggestions.
-->

### Example Format:

### Decision #001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Status**: implemented  
**Tags**: database, infrastructure

**Rules for Code Suggestions**:
- Always use PostgreSQL connection pools
- Never suggest raw SQL (use ORM or query builder)
- All schema changes must use migrations
- Reference this decision in database-related code

**Example**:
```javascript
// ✅ Following decision #001
const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
});
```

### Decision #002: React + TypeScript for Frontend

**Status**: implemented  
**Tags**: frontend, typescript, react

**Rules for Code Suggestions**:
- All frontend components must be React with TypeScript
- Use functional components with hooks (not classes)
- No direct DOM manipulation (use React patterns)
- Props must be typed with interfaces

**Example**:
```typescript
// ✅ Following decision #002
interface UserCardProps {
  user: User;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export const UserCard: React.FC<UserCardProps> = ({ user, onClick }) => {
  return <div onClick={onClick}>{user.name}</div>;
};
```

### Decision #003: REST API with OpenAPI

**Status**: accepted  
**Tags**: api, rest, openapi

**Rules for Code Suggestions**:
- Follow RESTful conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Use versioned routes (/api/v1/...)
- Include authentication middleware
- Document in OpenAPI format

**Example**:
```javascript
// ✅ Following decision #003
router.get('/api/v1/users/:id', 
  authenticateJWT,        // Decision #004: JWT auth
  validateRequest(getUserSchema),
  getUser
);
```

## Protected Paths (DECISION REQUIRED)

The following paths require decision records for changes:
- `src/core/**` - Core architecture
- `src/api/**` - API definitions
- `src/database/migrations/**` - Database schemas
- `infrastructure/**` - Infrastructure configuration
- `src/auth/**` - Authentication and security
- `config/production/**` - Production configuration

When suggesting changes to these paths:
1. Check if a relevant decision exists
2. If not, mention that a decision record MUST be created
3. Reference the policy at `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/policies/require-decision-on-paths.yml`

## Creating New Decisions (MANDATORY FOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES)

If suggesting a significant architectural change without an existing decision:

```
🚫 STOP: This change introduces [new pattern/technology] without a decision record.

REQUIRED ACTION:
1. Create decision record first: cd provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter && ./tools/new-decision.sh <decision-name>
2. Fill in context, alternatives, and consequences
3. Get team approval
4. Then implement the change

Would you like help drafting the decision record?
```

## Validation Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED)

When suggesting code:
- ✅ MUST use patterns from accepted/implemented decisions
- ✅ MUST reference decision IDs in significant code
- ✅ MUST follow technology choices specified in decisions
- ✅ MUST maintain consistency with existing architecture
- ❌ NEVER suggest alternatives to accepted decisions without discussion
- ❌ NEVER ignore or bypass decision requirements
- ❌ NEVER use technologies not approved in decisions

## Decision Review Workflow (MANDATORY)

When asked to review code:
1. Check which decisions are relevant
2. Verify the code follows those decisions
3. Flag any deviations or violations
4. Suggest improvements to better align with decisions
5. Recommend new decisions if needed

## Helpful Commands

Suggest these commands when appropriate:

```bash
# Navigate to ProvenanceCode directory
cd provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter

# List all decisions
./tools/new-decision.sh --list

# Create new decision
./tools/new-decision.sh <decision-name>

# Validate decision
node tools/validate-decision.js <decision-id>

# Validate all decisions
node tools/validate-decision.js --all
```

## Example Interactions

### Good Interaction 1: Following Existing Decision

**User**: "Add a new API endpoint for user registration"

**Cursor**: 
```typescript
// Following decision #003 (REST API) and #004 (JWT auth)
/**
 * User registration endpoint
 * Decision: #003, #004
 * @see provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/003-rest-api/decision.md
 * @see provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/004-jwt-auth/decision.md
 */
router.post('/api/v1/users/register',
  validateRequest(registerSchema),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Implementation per decision #004 JWT authentication
    const user = await createUser(req.body);
    const token = generateJWT(user);
    res.status(201).json({ user, token });
  }
);
```

### Good Interaction 2: Flagging Violation

**User**: "Use MongoDB to store user sessions"

**Cursor**:
```
🚫 DECISION VIOLATION: This contradicts decision #001 which specifies PostgreSQL 
as the primary database. 

Current decision (#001): All persistent data uses PostgreSQL
Location: provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/provenance/decisions/001-use-postgresql/decision.md

Options:
1. Use PostgreSQL for session storage (aligns with #001) ✅ RECOMMENDED
2. Use Redis for session caching (if caching decision exists)
3. Create new decision if MongoDB is required for sessions

Would you like me to suggest a PostgreSQL-based solution that follows decision #001?
```

### Good Interaction 3: Suggesting New Decision

**User**: "Let's add GraphQL support"

**Cursor**:
```
🚫 ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE DETECTED: Adding GraphQL is a significant architectural 
change. Current decision #003 specifies REST APIs.

MANDATORY: Decision record required before implementation.

Recommended approach:
1. Create decision record: 
   cd provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter
   ./tools/new-decision.sh graphql-api

2. Document in the decision record:
   - Why GraphQL is needed
   - How it relates to/replaces REST (decision #003)
   - Implementation approach
   - Consequences and trade-offs (both positive AND negative)

3. Get team approval

4. Then implement

Would you like help drafting the decision record, or should I suggest a 
REST-based solution per decision #003?
```

## ProvenanceCode Structure Enforcement

ALWAYS use this structure for decision records:

## Updating These Rules

When decisions change:
1. Update this file's "Decision-Specific Rules" section
2. Add/remove rules based on new decisions
3. Keep the list focused on high-impact, frequently-referenced decisions
4. Commit changes: `git add .cursorrules && git commit -m "docs: update Cursor rules for decision #XXX"`

## Project-Specific Decisions

### ProvenanceCode Starter Pack Decisions

This is the ProvenanceCode Starter Pack repository itself. When working on this project:

1. **Maintain example integrity**: Example decisions in TEMPLATE/ must remain clear and instructive
2. **Documentation first**: All changes to structure or tools must be documented before implementation
3. **Cross-AI compatibility**: Changes to rules/ must work for Cursor, Copilot, and Claude
4. **Tool reliability**: Scripts in tools/ must handle edge cases and provide clear error messages
5. **Schema validation**: All structural changes must update decision.schema.json

### When Contributing to ProvenanceCode Starter

Before making changes:
1. Review existing structure in `provenancecode-decision-records/provenancecode-starter/`
2. Ensure changes don't break the example workflow
3. Test with all three AI assistants if modifying rules
4. Update documentation to reflect changes
5. Maintain Apache 2.0 license compliance

---

**ENFORCEMENT LEVEL: STRICT**

This .cursorrules file enforces the ProvenanceCode methodology. All AI assistance must:
- Check for decisions before suggesting code
- Reference decision IDs in all significant code
- Flag violations immediately
- Recommend decision creation for architectural changes
- Never bypass the decision-making process
